Multiple services under different category headers:
Compute, Developer Tools, Analytics etc.
New services are added all the time.

Critical services to know:
AWS Global Infrastructure
Networking and Content Delivery
Compute
Storage
Databases
Security & Identity
Management Tools
Messaging
Desktop and App Streaming

1) AWS Global Infratsructure
The physical infrastructure on which AWS runs - classified into regions and availability zones.
Globally 14 regions and 38 availability zones - 2016
More planned to be added in 2017
A region is a geographical area that consists of 2 or more availability zones.
An availability zone is simply a Data Center. Availability zones in a region will be close to each other, but not dependent on each other. Kind of like a backup, hence at least 2 AZs in a region.

Edge locations are CDN End Points fro CloudFront. CDNs cache large data files in data centers making them easily available. The first time a large data file is accessed from a remote location, it has to travel all the way - but the next time another user from the same region accesses the same file it will be cached locally. 66 Edge locations in 2016.

North America has 5 regions, the largest in the world

2) Networking and Content delivery:
VPC - Virtual Private Cloud (virtual data center) Very important for exam.
Route53 - Amazons DNS server. 53 is the DNS port.
CloudFront - part of CDN.
Direct Connect - dedicated connection to AWS (for security, pushing large data sets etc).

3) Compute:
EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual machines on the cloud 
EC2 Container Service - scalable container management service that manages Docker containers.
Elastic Beanstalk - If you know nothing about AWS and you want to run your app, you can upload your app into this, it takes care of everything.
Lambda - serverless, upload code and it responds to events.
Lightsail - out of the box service.

4) Storage:
S3 (simple storage service) - virtual disk in the cloud to store objects (files). Not used to install and app. Dropbox used it first.
Glacier - archive files when instant access is not needed. Low cost, take 
EFS - Elastic file servers, block-based storage, install dbs apps etc and share with multiple VMs
Storage Gateway - install on premises, communicate with S3

5) Databases:
RDS - Relational database service (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL server etc.)
DynamoDB - NoSQL scalable DB
Redshift - Data warehousing solution
Elasticache - caching your most frequently accessed data

6) Migration services:
Snowball - Tool/appliance for migrating terabytes worth of data. Do it yourself and send to Amazon. Snowball Edge can be used to have AWS on premises.
DMS - database migration services. Migrate dbs to the cloud. It handles all the data transfer. Supports all major DBs.
SMS: server migration services, to migrate VMs/serves onto the cloud.

7) Analytics:
Athena: allows running SQL queries on S3 (CSV files, JSON files etc), turns your flat files into databases
EMR - elastic map reduce, to process large amounts of data using Hadoop.
Cloud Search - search capabilities to your web app
Elastic Search - same, but based on open source
Kinesis - streaming and analyzing real time data, financial data etc
Data Pipeline - service that allows data from one place to another.
Quick Sight - business analytics tool

8) Security and Identity:
IAM - Identity Access Management. Fundamental entity in AWS.
Inspector - Agent you install on your VMs.
Certificate Manager - free SSL certificates
Directory Service - connect an AD to AWS
WAF - Wen Appln Firewall. Appln level support to your app (SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
Artifacts - Compliance documents

9) Management Tools:
CloudWatch - Monitor how your apps are doing, CPU , disk usage etc.
CloudFormation - Turning infrastructure into code instead of physical hardware like firewall etc. Very important.
CloudTrail - auditing changes to AWS environment.
Opsworks -
Config - automatic monitoring of your envnt.
Service Catalog
Trusted Advisor - optimization, security fixes etc

10) Application services:
Step Functions - what is going on inside your app
SWF - Simple workflow services, coordinating your requests with what needs to be dono your AWS accounte
API Gateway - create, publish, maintain your apps
AppStream - streaming desktop apps to clients
Elastic Transcoder - changes video formats to suit device

11) Developer Tools:
CodeCommit - Github, store code in the cloud
CodeBuild - compiling code
CodeDeploy - deploy to your EC2 instance
CodePipeline - keep track of diff versions of your code

12)Misc
Mobile Services:
Mobile Hub
Cognito
Device farm
Mobile Analytics
Pinpoint

Business Productivity:

IoT:
Devices to communicate and share data amongst themselves
Desktop & App Streaming:
Workspaces - Desptop in the cloud
AppStream

Artificial Intelligence:
Alexa - voice recognition service
Polly- text to speech service
Machine Learning
Rekognition - pic and facial recognition

Messaging:
SNS
SQS
SES
------------------------------------
Identity access management (IAM)
Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.
Gives you centralized access of your AWS account.
Shared Access to your AWS account.
Users, Groups and Roles
Policies (defined in JSON) can be applied to all three
.
.
.
------------------------------------
Storage:
S3 Simple Storage Service
Object based storage - flat file storage as opposed to block based, which is used for servers/databases etc. 
Cloudberry provides windows explorer like interface to S3
Files can be 0-5TB in size, stored as buckets
Buckets must be named uniquely
Bucket has an URL assocaited with it usually of the format https://s3-<dns depending on amazon region>/<bucket name>
Once you have the URL you can upload the file and get an http response code that tells you if your upload was successful

Data Consistency in S3
- Read and Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects: you can read the object right away 
- updates might take a short while to propagate - you will get either the new version or the old, not partial ones - called atomic)

Object based storage, key-value store
- key is the name of the object and value is the data itself
- Version ID (for versioning)
- Metadata (Data about the data you are storing)
- Subresources
    - access control lists (who can access)
    - Torrent

99.9% availability, 99.9999...% durability
Tiered storage
Lifecycle management (upto 30 days at one place, then move elsewhere and after 90 days archive)
Encryption

Storage Tiers
S3 - stored across multiple facilities
S3-IA - Infrequently accessed data, lower fee than regular S3, but charged a retrieval fee
Reduced Redundancy Storage - eg.thumbnail storage
Glacier - Very cheap, used only for archival only, takes 3-5 hrs to restore
